## Team Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication Protocols
1. **Regular Standups:** Brief sync during development phases
2. **Blocker Resolution:** Escalate blockers to the team for collaborative problem-solving
3. **Code Reviews:** All code must be reviewed by at least one team member
4. **Documentation:** Update README and comments as you develop

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature branch workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create PR via GitHub/GitLab interface

# After review and approval
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/your-feature-name
```

### Code Standards
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Function naming:** Use descriptive names with team prefix
- **Error handling:** Always implement proper error handling
- **Logging:** Use structured logging with context
- **Documentation:** Include docstrings for all functions

### Resource Management
- **Shared Resources:** Use team prefix for all shared resources
- **Individual Resources:** Use team-user prefix for personal resources
- **Cost Management:** Monitor costs and optimize resource usage
- **Clean Up:** Remove unnecessary resources regularly
